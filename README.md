This repository contains codes for homework assignments and projects assigned to me during one of my classes in my masters.
All these assignments have been done on R and the resulting code and analysis have been reported through a word document.

* hw01- Assignment on R Programming Language
* hw02- Assignment on Linear Regression 
* hw03- Assignment on Classification(Logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA))
* hw04- Assignment on Validation and Cross validation techniques.
* hw05- Assignment on Hyperparamter optimization( subset selection- forward, backward , stepwise|| Direct Approaches- Cp, AIC, BIC, Adj R squared|| shrinakge methods- LASSO and RIDGE)
* hw06- Assignment on Decision Trees( bagging, Random Forest, Boosting)
* hw07- Assignment on Support Vector Machines( using different kernels such as Linear, Radial, Gaussian etc)
